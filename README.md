# SpaceRangerIDCard

This is a simple HTML CSS Javascript project where you input info and it will display it on an ID card.

I really had fun playing with this project adding a space like theme, almost as if you were looking out the window of a spaceship.
The RGB background was fun a ton of fun and adds an awesome effect when you run the code.
